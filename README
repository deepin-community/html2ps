Brief history:

  941212 0.1   - First public release - text-only documents.
  950407 0.2   - Inline images.
  970609 1.0b  - Support for most of HTML 3.2, configuration files introduced.
  970809 1.0b1 - Bug fixes. Some HTML 4.0 support, e.g. OBJECT, INS, DEL,
                 and ACRONYM.
  000727 1.0b2 - Mostly bug fixes. A title page can be generated. The symbol
                 set is extended to include information from META elements.
                 Installation script modified for Windows support.
  000815 1.0b3 - Bug fixes. Some support for Server Side Includes. Form
                 element contents can be rendered. Support for netscape
                 cookies.
  050225 1.0b4   Various bug fixes.
  051211 1.0b5   Bug fixes. Added -M option.
  091021 1.0b6   "Security" fix. Changed behavior for SSI, to avoid having
                 arbitrary readable files disclosed on a web server that uses
                 html2ps in a web application (cgi script etc), allowing HTML
                 files to be uploaded for conversion. Setting up a service like
                 this is begging for trouble in my opinion. (Is /bin/cat also
                 a vulnerability, since one can use it in a web app, allowing
                 uploading arbitrary parameters to it?)
  100507 1.0b7   Fixed a bug introduced by the previous bug fix...
